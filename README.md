# Unit-3-Interactive-Form

Creating an interactive form with Javascript
In this project, I used Javascript to make a form interactive. I created various function, helper functions, user for loop, dynamically inserted HTML via javascript, and used various event listener handlers.
I created validation/ accessibility functions that would be inserted in an eventhandler on the form element with the submit handler. Once clicked, the user will be notified of which fields are correct or incorrect.
